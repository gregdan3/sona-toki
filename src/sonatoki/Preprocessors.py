"""
"Preprocessors" are classes which strip content from a given string prior to tokenization.
There are currently two distinct types of Preprocessor:

- Remove a token from a string which would be difficult to identify after tokenization.
  - URLs
  - DiscordEmotes
- Remove a section of a string which is contained in or marked by certain character(s). Also called "Containers"
  - SingleQuotes
  - DoubleQuotes
  - Backticks
  - Spoilers
  - ArrowQuote

Order does not generally matter, but if there were two overlapping containers such as in the string "|| spoiler ` monospace || `", order would matter.
It is up to the user to order them appropriately.

The following classes are Ignorables.

Ignorables are tokens which do not count toward the accepted number of tokens

This is generally because they are considered external to Toki Pona.

It is likely that every user will want to use these.
Not having them will cause many false negatives, such as when a URL is divided
into its parts and checked as a token.

    However, all emojis are considered punctuation by this library,

    It will leave behind the component emojis, which will be ignored.

    But ZWJ cannot be considered punctuation for tokenizing purposes because it is used in the middle of words to render them differently.
    In this vein, ZWJ is a function character.

    In the future, it may be smarter to omit ZWJ in the tokenization process,
    or to make the tokenizer smarter by having it keep together collected emojis.
